# RestApiGuide
## A step by step guide on how to implement clean, maintainable RESTful APIs
## Overview
RESTful is not a new term. It refers to an architectural style where web services receive and send data from and to client apps. The goal of these applications is to centralize data that different client apps will use.

Choosing the right tools to write RESTful services is crucial since we need to care about scalability, maintenance, documentation, and all other relevant aspects. The ASP.NET Core gives us a powerful, easy to use API that is great to achieve these goals.

In this article, I’ll show you how to write a well structured RESTful API for an “almost” real world scenario, using the ASP.NET Core framework. I’m going to detail common patterns and strategies to simplify the development process.

I’ll also show you how to integrate common frameworks and libraries, such as Entity Framework Core and AutoMapper, to deliver the necessary functionalities.
